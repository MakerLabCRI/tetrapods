# Tetrapods of Many Materials

This project showcases the creation of the same wave-breaker tetrapod miniature using various materials and manufacturing techniques.

## Overview

A tetrapod can be constructed in CAD by rotating one arm from a flag-shape, then duplicating it and placing the copy at an angle equal to the dihedral angle of a tetrahedron (acos(-1/3)) about the center. The remaining two arms are created by cloning one arm about the axis of the other in a circular pattern.

## FDM Printed Tetrapod

- **Description**: The simplest file in the set, representing the 3D shape of the final product as an STL file.
- **Printing**: A 3D printer reproduces the shape in one shot, requiring no assembly or post-processing.
- **Orientation**: There is one optimal orientation for printing to avoid the need for supports.
- **Variations**: A two-color version is available, featuring a segmented outer shell and a differently-colored inner part.

## SLA Printed Tetrapod

- **Source File**: Utilizes the same file as FDM printing.
- **Post-Processing**: Requires removal of supports. The shape has a considerable inner volume that must be left hollow and drained.

## Laser Cut Tetrapod

- **Pieces**: 14 interlocking pieces cut from 3 mm thick materials like plywood or acrylic.
- **Design Considerations**: Slots in mating pieces are sized to account for material thickness, cutting tool kerf, and the angle of intersection.

## Papercraft Tetrapod

- **Construction**: Each arm is unrolled to a fan-shape and cut from cardstock.
- **Assembly**: Uses tape or tabs and slots for joining.
- **Technique**: Developed using sketch tools or recreated in Fusion 360's Sheet Metal workspace for unfolding.

## Cloth Tetrapod

- **Template**: Uses the unrolled shape from the papercraft version.
- **Sewing**: Sown with a sewing machine, inside out, and then reversed for stuffing.
- **Finishing**: Arms are sewn closed with extra cloth for allowance.
- **Details**: Challenges include aligning fabric during sewing and capping off cones or cylinders effectively.
- **Accessories**: Eye-shaped buttons created using the FDM printer.

## Plaster of Paris Tetrapod

- **Mold**: Tetrahedral four-piece FDM printed mold.
- **Casting**: Uses Plaster of Paris, which is thick enough to not require gaskets.
- **Finishing**: Pour flute is cut off and sanded; seams and flashing can also be sanded.

## Candle Tetrapod

- **Mold**: Utilizes the same FDM printed mold as the plaster version.
- **Wick**: Wick can be strung along the angles of the tetrapod arms.
- **Material**: Cast using paraffin, which melts at around 50Â°C and is safe for PLA molds.

## Upcoming Variations

- Vacuum Formed Tetrapod
- CNC Machined Tetrapod
- Water Jet Tetrapod
- Lathe-Turned Tetrapod
